    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        The Murud Janjira Fort(Murud Janjira Killa) located in the city of Murud, 165 km from Mumbai, is a unique specimen of India’s historical military engineering. This oval impregnable fort is surrounded by water from all sides or it can be said. This fort is built in the middle of the sea. This fort is one of the few forts in India that no ruler could win in history.
    </p>
    <p>
        Friends Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj had also made efforts to win this Murud JanjiraFort, but he too was not successful in winning it. After him, Sambhaji Maharaj attacked this fort, but he too failed to win it. Although Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj was successful in making the way to this fort.

        How Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj made this impossible work possible. Before knowing the answer to this question, let us know that the word Janjira is an aberration of the Arabic word Jazeera. This fort was built in the Arabian Sea by a Koli king in the late 1200s to deal with pirates. There is also a well in this fort which, despite being in the middle of the sea, is the source of freshwater for the people living here.
        
        You can reach this fort via the coastal village of Murud. The most special thing about this fort is that it is surrounded by water from all sides, hence it is also called Island Fort. This mighty coastal fort, situated 55 km from Alibaug in Maharashtra, is like no other in the whole of India.
        
        The Murud-Janjira Fort, built on a huge rock in the Arabian Sea, has withstood the test of time in history, thwarted and destroyed many powerful attacks to withstand them. This fort situated on the Konkan coast of Maharashtra used to be the capital of Jarira state history. Earlier this entire area was known as Janjira, but now only this fort is known as Janjira.
    </p>
    <p>
        Janjira Fort was an important bastion of African principles that played an important role in the history of Mumbai in the late 17th century, which were known to have excellent sailors and merchants. When he came to India, he made this fort his home, and once settled here, he stayed here. After this, this fort became a symbol of his strength and prosperity in the future.

Janjira fort’s history has a long. Attempts were made to conquer this fort many times by the rulers who ruled India, but all of them were unsuccessful. British, Portuguese, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, and Veer Sambhaji also made many attacks on this fort but they all failed to win it.

The carvings on the main entrance of this fort depict six elephants all surrounded by a tiger. This carving of the main gate of the fort shows the bravery of centuries. It is said that there was a time when there were 500 cannons in this fort, which were used to protect the strength of this fort. Talking about the present time, today only selected cannons are left in this fort, but these selected cannons are also fully capable of showing their history.
